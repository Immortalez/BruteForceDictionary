# BruteForceDictionary
Generator of dictionary with all possible combinations of specified characters and length.

### About
My first project in Python (started learning it literally yesterday [19.01.19]), therefore there's a lot of efficiency improvements to be done.
Program generates all possible combinations out of given character set, within given length interval.
The combinations are saved to a text file, each in a separate line.
