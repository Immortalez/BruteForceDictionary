# BruteForceDictionary
Generator of dictionary with all possible combinations of specified characters and length.

### About
My first project in Python (literally started learning it yesterday), therefore there's a lot of efficiency improvements to be done.
Program generates all possible combinations out of given character set, within given length interval.

Everything will eventually be saved into the specified file, by default _dictionary.txt_.

### Exemplary Output
Some parts of the output for charset _abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_, length _[5, 5]_.
